# Micro-Service-Simple-Banc-Operation-Project

We have two services , one for authentification and the other for crud and logics (just an exemple of two services which work independently but can communicate each other) .. 
Just use inteliji or  maven to install dependances...create a network name "app-network" using docker command... run " docker-compose up -d " inside each module (Each of 4 modules) to generate images and container then it's should be fine.
NB : this micro-service has a frontend part coded with Angular... this part is not included in this repo...it's just the micro services.
